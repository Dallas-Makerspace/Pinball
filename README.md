pinball
=======

This is an pinball high score web application written in laraval, a free open source popular framework.  In order to use this web application you will need to install the sql file and go into app/mail and fill out your smtp credentials.  You will also need to install the sql file in the top level of the application and go into app/database.php and fill out the database credentials as well.  These were left out for security reasons, but you can just use google gmail if you want.   That what I using.   Really simple to setup.  You will need to add pictures of the machines and high score pictures for the slide show to work.  This application is done without and warranty and is given free of charge.  You can use it for whatever you want and your bug fixes are welcome.  I plan on adding stuff to it like tournaments and other things.  You also don't have to use it for pinball, you could for example use this to keep track of darts or golf.

Good luck and have fun.
